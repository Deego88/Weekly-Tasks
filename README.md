# WEEKLY TASKS README

I initially created individual repositories for each weekly task. Upon listening to advice in the lectures- it’s probably best to only have one central location. I then moved copied from the original repository and then pasted into the “weekly tasks folder”. Therefore, my commit history in the folder "weekly tasks" may look like everything was completed very late, this is not the case as you can see the history in the individual repositories.
