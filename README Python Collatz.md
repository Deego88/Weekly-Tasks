# Topic-4-Controlling-the-flow

If tells python to conditionally execute a piece of code. 
The moduleo divides the left side of the % by the right and gives the remainder.

The ==0 check to see if its equal to 0, this is used in order to control the flow of the program. 

The while functions runs the program while something is true. 
Else is used to show distinction between statements.

The user inputs a positive integer 
a while loop and two conditions are created:
  one condition checks to see if the integer is even by using (a % b) ==0
  one condition checks to see if the integer is odd by using (a % b) !=0
    if off its * 3 and 1 is added
    
 The result is printed to the screen
